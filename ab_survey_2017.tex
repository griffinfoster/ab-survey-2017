The ALFABURST fast radio burst (FRB) survey has been observing commensally with
other projects using the ALFA receiver since July 2015. We report on the
non-detection of any FRBs from that time until June 2017. With current FRB rate
models we expected to see multiple FRBs based on the total observing time,
telescope sensitivity and beam size. We discuss the implications for this
non-detection FRBs in the context of recent detections with other telescopes.

\section{Introduction}

% TODO: edit
The first FRB~\citep{2007Sci...318..777L} was detected in a reprocessing of data
from a survey of the Magellanic Clouds~\citep{2006ApJ...649..235M}, with an
estimated flux density of $30\pm10$~Jy. The detection of this event led to a
spurt in single pulse searches, conducted on both archival data (burke-spolaor?)
as well as data from surveys specially designed to look for such events.
\citet{2012ApJ...744..109S} conducted a wide-field survey using the Allen
Telescope Array, in which each of the forty two antennas of the array was
pointed in a different direction. Although this configuration rendered the
limiting fluence high ($\sim$111~kJy~$\mu$s), it allowed a large field of view
($\sim$147~deg$^2$). The survey resulted in no detection, and yielded an event
rate of 2~sky$^{-1}$~hr$^{-1}$ for 10~ms-wide pulses with flux density greater
than 44~Jy.


\subsection{Repeater}

% TODO: edit
FRB121102 was discovered in the Pulsar- ALFA (PALFA) survey as a highly
dispersed bright single radio pulse in beam 4 with a dispersion measure (DM) of
~559 $\rm cm^{-3}~pc$. The results of the single pulse detection were published
in~\cite{2014ApJ...790..101S}. The authors also compute a FRB rate based on the
single detection. Based on the numerical model of the ALFA beams, they obtained
a Field of View (FoV) weighted gain of the system and the instantaneous FoV. The
total time on sky was computed as the difference of total observation time and
total data masked due to Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). Thus, assuming
Poissonian statistics for the FRB rate, they compute the best FRB rate for the
computed flux sensitivity of PALFA. They also report FRB rate for flux
sensitivity corresponding to a gain  greater than 0.4 K~$\rm Jy^-1$ which
corresponds to the average gain of the Parkes multi-beam receiver. After the
initial discovery, more radio follow-up was carried out with no detections at
any of the epochs. The follow-up continued into the next year
when~\cite{2016Natur.531..202S} reported the discovery of 10 new bursts in 2015.
The bursts had the same DM as the discovery burst and the detections were within
a few arc seconds from the initial detection suggesting that the later pulses
came from the same source. The authors were unable to find a period for the
bursts and also discuss the possiblity that these could be RFI though all the
observational evidence suggests that the source is astrophysical.

This discovery generated a lot of interest in multi-wavelength follow-up
efforts.~\cite{2016ApJ...833..177S} report the first multi-wavelength follow-up
results where seven more bursts were detected, all in radio and two from the
Green Bank Telescope taking the total to 17 pulses. They reported an interesting
frequency structure the pulses have which varies on a pulse to pulse
basis.~\cite{2016Natur.531..202S} had already showed that the pulses had
peculiar frequency behaviour which cannot be explained by scintillation effects
in the ISM and the IGM. This, along with the large range of spectral indices
($-$13 -- 5) observed in the bursts led the authors to believe that the emission
variability is intrinsic to the source. The discovery of repeating bursts led to
a massive campaign using the Very Large Array (VLA) in order to detect and
localize the FRB to arcsecond precision.~\cite{2017Natur.541...58C} reported a
successful localization of FRB 121102 with the final position of the burst with
an error of 100~mas. Such precise localization made discovery of a counterpart
plausible. The paper also reports a discovery of a persistent radio source which
is offset by $\sim$12~mas from the point source.~\cite{2017ApJ...834L...8M} make
a strong argument for the association for the persistent radio source and the
FRB based on high resolution European VLBI Network (EVN) observations and also
report that the flux variation of the radio source are unlike what would be
expected from an Active Galactic Nuclei.~\cite{2017ApJ...834L...7T} presented
the results of the detection of an optical counterpart associated with the radio
source and thus with the FRB. Based on the spectrum of the optical source, they
conclude that it is a mag 25.5AB starforming dwarf galaxy with a total mass of
$7 \times$10$^{7}~\rm M_{\odot}$. They also argue that though the optical
signatures are unlike any seen from an AGN with optical counterparts, a lot of
AGNs are discovered where the optical counterpart is absent and hence no claims
on the radio source can be made. They also suggest that localizing such repeater
source would be easier if the field was searched for optical spectra similar to
the one shown by this source. The big assumption here is that there is a strong
relationship between the FRB and the type of hosts where they are found.

\section{ALFABURST Overview}

ALFABURST is an \gls*{frb} search instrument which has been used to commensally
observe since July 2015 with other \gls*{alfa} observations at Arecibo
Observatory. This system is a component of the SETIBURST back-end
\citep{2017ApJS..228...21C} and uses ARTEMIS \citep{2015MNRAS.452.1254K} for
automated, real-time detection. During this time period an \gls*{sps} was
performed from \gls*{dm} 0 to 10000, pulse width from $256 \mu s$ to $16$ ms,
across a 56 MHz bandwidth for all 7 beams. Detections above an \gls*{snr} of 10
were recorded along with an $8.4$ second dynamic spectrum window around the
event. If multiple events were detected in the same time window, these events
were pooled together.  Approximately 150k windows were recorded between July
2015 and June 2017, the vast majority of which are false detections due to
\gls*{rfi} signals passing through the real-time \gls*{rfi} exciser. We detect
no \glspl*{frb} in our commensal survey.

A wide-feature, learned model was used to classify the event windows in order to
filter out \gls*{rfi} and create a priority queue for visual examination. This
model and the post-processing procedures are discussed in Section
\ref{sec:event_classify}. We discuss the expected event rates in Section
\ref{sec:event_rates} and consider possible explanations for our non-detection
result in Section \ref{sec:discuss}.

%%% OBSERVATION TIME BEGINS %%%

From the beginning of July 2015 to the end of June 2017 \gls*{alfa} has been
used for approximately 1400 hours of observing, with all seven beams functional.
Due to pipeline development and hardware reliability ALFABURST was active and
functional for, on average, 322 hours per beam.  The current system is setup to
be reliably in use for all beams any time \gls*{alfa} is active and in the
correct receiver turret position. Of the survey coverage, approximately 65\% of
the time has been in pointings out of the galactic plane ($|b| > 5^{\circ}$).
These pointings are primarly from to the ongoing AGES survey.  Pointings in the
plane are primarily from the PALFA survey. Since we are searching up to a
\gls{dm} of 10000 the survey is still sensitive to \glspl{frb} at cosmological
distances when observing in the galactic plane. But, scintillation effects can
reduce the overall \gls{frb} event rates \citep{2015MNRAS.451.3278M}.

%%% OBSERVATION TIME ENDS   %%%

%%% EVENT RATES BEGINS %%%

\section{Expected FRB Event Rates}
\label{sec:event_rates}

As of this writing, only 23 \glspl{frb} have been reported. As these events vary
significantly in \gls{dm}, pulse width, and flux density we assume a simple
model to derive an expected event rate with our survey.  We use the a model
\citep{2013MNRAS.436L...5L} which assumes \gls{frb} sources are standard candles
with a fixed spectral index, uniformly distributed in comoving volume. The
events rates in this model are scaled to the event rates reported in
\cite{2013Sci...341...53T}.

We use two beam models to derive our expected rates. The first is a simple
\gls{fwhm} beam size with a fixed sensitivity limit that allows us to sample a
constant co-moving volume. We also use a model which accounts for the \gls{alfa}
first side lobes. This results in a sky coverage and sensitivity which varies as
a function of beam gain. This model results in a higher expected event rate than
the simple \gls{fwhm} model. We use this full beam model as the Arecibo dish
provides high sensitivity at the cost of a smaller beam size. The side lobes of
the \gls{alfa} feed would be sensitive to many of the previously detected
\glspl{frb}. By including the full beam we improve our survey coverage while
still being sensitive to these brighter \glspl{frb}.

\subsection{FWHM Beam}
\label{sec:fwhm_beam_rates}

An \gls*{alfa} beam is approximately 3.8' x 3.3' at \gls*{fwhm} across the band.
Given the average observing time per beam of 322 hours this results in a survey
coverage of $6.2 \; \textrm{deg}^2 \; \textrm{hours}$. 
% TODO: how does this survey metric compare to other surveys?

Using Equation 6 of \cite{2015MNRAS.452.1254K}, an \gls*{sps} pipeline is
sensitive to pulses with a minimum flux density (in Jy) of
%
\begin{equation}
S_{min} = \textrm{SEFD} \frac{\textrm{SNR}_{min}}{\sqrt{D \; \Delta \tau \;
\Delta \nu}}
\end{equation}
%
which is a function of the telescope \gls*{sefd}, the minimum \gls*{snr}
detection level $\textrm{SNR}_{min}$ and the decimation rate $D$ compared to the
native instrumental time resolution $\tau$, this comes from the search pipeline
which averages together spectra to search for scattered pulses. ALFABURST has a
native resolution of $\Delta \tau = 256 \; \mu s$, effective bandwidth $\Delta
\nu = 56 \textrm{MHz}$, and $\textrm{SNR}_{min} = 10$. The \gls*{sefd} of the
\gls*{alfa} receiver is approximately 3 Jy across the band for all beams.

The \gls{sps} pipeline is configured to search for pulses from 256 $\mu$s to 16
ms. Assuming a matched filter this results in a sensitivity to pulses with a
minimum flux of $S_{256 \mu\textrm{s}} = 250$ mJy to $S_{16 \; \textrm{ms}} =
31$ mJy. Figure \ref{fig:fwhm_sefd_z} shows the peak flux density of using the
standard candle \gls{frb} model as a function of source redshift for different
model spectral indices. The dashed lines of constant flux is the sensitivity of
the ALFABURST search pipeline to pulses of different widths. Assuming a positive
spectral index model ($\alpha=1.4$) results in a sensitivity out to the maximum redshift
/\gls{dm} for pulses with widths of at least 1 ms. A flat spectral index model
results in sensitivity from $z \sim 1.5$ out to $z \sim 5$ depending of pulse
width. A negative spectral index model ($\alpha \sim -1.4$) limits the survey to
$z < 3$.

    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/fwhm_sefd_z_relation.pdf}
    \caption{Sensitivity of the ALFABURST search pipeline (dashed) to FRB pulses
    assuming a standard candle model using different spectral index models
    (solid).
    }
    \label{fig:fwhm_sefd_z}
\end{figure}

We will assume a simple model of $\alpha=0$ as we have limited information about
the source spectral index. And, we will use a pulse width of 4 ms as that is an
approximate median pulse width of reported \glspl{frb}. This results in a
maximum redshift of $z=3.4$ (a co-moving distance of 6.8 Gpc) and a survey volume
of $4.2 \times 10^6$ Mpc$^3$ when using all 7 \gls{alfa} beams. The number of
galaxies sampled in this volume is $4 \times 10^5$ assuming a constant galaxy
number density of $10^{-2}$ per Mpc$^3$.  The volumetric event rate from
\cite{2013Sci...341...53T} is stated to be $R_{\textrm{FRB}} = 10^{-3}$
\glspl{frb} per galaxy per year. We should expect to detect $\sim 1.5$
\glspl{frb} based on the current observation time.

\subsection{Primary Beam and First Side Lobes}
\label{sec:full_beam_rates}

In Section \ref{sec:fwhm_beam_rates} we are only take into account the beam
size out to the \gls{fwhm}. We can take into account the entire first side lobes
of the beams as Arecibo would be sensitive to detect most previous
\glspl{frb} in the first side lobes. Using the parameterized \gls{alfa} beam
model (Figure \ref{fig:alfa_beam}) \citep{GALFAbeam} we can compute the
\gls{frb} survey metric and expected rates as a function of beam sensitivity.
The first side lobes peak at around $-10$ dB and provide a significant increase
in sky coverage compared to just the primary lobes.

% alfaburst-initial-survey/notebooks/ALFABURST_Derived_FRB_Rates.ipynb
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/ALFA_beam_1425MHz_dB.pdf}
    \caption{Primary and first side lobe model of the AFLA receiver in
    decibels, cut-off at $-30$ dB.The first side lobe peak at around $-9$ dB.
    }
    \label{fig:alfa_beam}
\end{figure}

The total survey metric can be computed as a function of the beam sensitivity by
integrating over the beam (Figure \ref{fig:survey_metric_sense}). The flux
threshold has been set by assigning the $-3$ dB the same sensitivity as the
\gls{fwhm} sensitivity. The segment which increased the survey metric to
approximately $20 \; \textrm{deg}^2$ hours is due to including more of the
primary beam beyond the \gls{fwhm} point. The steep increase in the survey
metric is from including the first side lobes. The long tail is from the residual
sensitivity by integrating over the remaining beam.

% alfaburst-initial-survey/notebooks/ALFABURST_Derived_FRB_Rates.ipynb
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/full_survey_metric_sense.pdf}
    \caption{Survey metric as a function of the ALFA receiver minimum
    sensitivity using the ALFA primary and first side lobes.
    }
    \label{fig:survey_metric_sense}
\end{figure}

The significant increase in the survey metric only modestly improves our survey
volume. Plotting the survey metric as a function of maximum redshift (Figure
\ref{fig:full_sefd_z}) shows that the full beam model increases the survey
volume out to $z<1.5$. Including additional ALFA side lobes would have minimal
increase in the survey volume.

% alfaburst-initial-survey/notebooks/ALFABURST_Derived_FRB_Rates.ipynb
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/full_sefd_z_relation.pdf}
    \caption{Survey metric as a function of redshift using the standard candle
    model with a flat spectral index ($\alpha=0$) and pulse width of 4 ms. The
    bump out to $z=1.5$ is due to the including the ALFA first side lobes.
    }
    \label{fig:full_sefd_z}
\end{figure}

Accounting for this extra survey coverage results in an integrated survey volume
of $5.8 \time 10^6$ Mpc$^3$. The expected number of \glspl{frb} in the survey is
$\sim 2$ when using the same galaxy number density and $R_{\textrm{FRB}}$ as
Section \ref{sec:fwhm_beam_rates}.

\subsection{Sensitivity Upper Limit}
\label{sec:upper_limit}

Part of the \gls{sps} pipeline is a parameterized \gls{rfi} exciser. The choice
of these parameters sets an upper limit on the flux of a pulse before it a
portion of the flux is clipped and replaced. Individual frequency channels in a
spectra are replaced when they exceed a threshold $T_{\textrm{chan}}$ after the
spectra is normalized ($\mu=0$, $\sigma=1$). And, entire spectra are clipped
when the summed spectra exceeds a threshold $T_{\textrm{spectra}}$. For standard
ALFABURST operation $T_{\textrm{chan}} = 5$ and $T_{\textrm{spectra}} = 10$.

For very bright, small \gls{dm} pulses the \gls{rfi} exciser will replace
channels or spectra, reducing the overall flux or potentially removing the
entire pulse.  For bright, high \gls{dm} pulses the spectra will likely not be
replaced, but individual channels may be, resulting in a lower detected flux.
The \gls{rfi} exciser only works in the undecimated-in-time case ($D=1$), that
is the sensitivity that we are most concerned about when setting the \gls{rfi}
exciser thresholds.

\glspl{frb} detected at L-Band range between 200 mJy to a few Jy in flux
density, typically on the order of 5-10 milliseconds. For the sensitivity of the
\gls{alfa} receiver, individual channels of flux greater than 2.8 Jy will be
flagged, this will not have an effect on our ability to detect even the
brightest \glspl{frb}.  The maximum integrated pulse flux ($256 \mu$s width,
\gls{dm}$=0$) is $\sim250$ mJy before the pulse is clipped. The maximum
detectable flux increases as the square-root of the pulse width.  We see in
verification observations of bright, low \gls{dm} pulsars that individual
pulses are often excised. But, as we are interested in detecting high \gls{dm}
\glspl{frb} we have a higher upper limit as the flux is spread over multiple
spectra.

For reference the minimum \gls{dm} of a pulse before the at least one channel is
shifted to the next spectra in time is \gls{dm}$=1.8$ for the typical ALFABURST
observing band (using Eq. 5.1 of \cite{2004hpa..book.....L}). And, the minimum
\gls{dm} before each frequency channel is in a separate spectra is
\gls{dm}$=976$. Most reported \glspl{frb} fall with in this \gls{dm} range, so
we consider an a test \gls{frb} with a dispersion measure of 250 and narrow
pulse width of $256 \mu$s to report our survey upper-limit sensitivity. A
\gls{dm} of 250 results in approximately $1/128$ of the pulse per spectra. A
bright pulse ($>32$ Jy) would be excised as \gls{rfi} in this test case. This an
extreme case, as most \glspl{frb} are wider in width and at higher \glspl{dm}.
Our pipeline would not excise all detected \glspl{frb} except the extreme
FRB150807.  This also assumes the \gls{frb} is detected at boresight, we would
still be sensitive to such bright pulses in the side lobes.

\section{Survey Coverage}
\label{sec:survey_coverage}

Since ALFABURST was installed, the majority of ALFA observation time is
allocated for the AGES \citep{2006MNRAS.371.1617A} and PALFA
\citep{2006ApJ...637..446C} surveys (Figure \ref{fig:sky_coverage}).  The AGES
survey pointing is off the galactic plane, thus there is little dispersion and
scattering due to the galactic \gls*{ism}. PALFA is a pulsar search survey with
pointings near the galactic plane. These lines of sight can introduce
significant dispersion due to the \gls*{ism}. We search out to a DM of 10000
which is well beyond the maximum galactic dispersion, even when \gls*{igm}
dispersion is accounted for from sources of cosmological distances. The PALFA
survey detected the repeating \gls{frb} FRB121102 \citep{2014ApJ...790..101S},
the only \gls{frb} detected with Arecibo thus far. As ALFABURST has been running
commensally with the PALFA survey since 2015 these two backends act as
independent \gls{sps} pipelines, useful for detection verification.

\section{System Verification}
\label{sec:system_verify}

PALFA survey scheduling includes regularly observing known pulsars to verify
timing analysis, this provides a consistent verification of our \gls*{sps} to
detect pulses. As the PALFA survey is performed in the galactic plane a number
of high \gls*{dm} pulsars were observed, single pulses from B1859+03 (\gls*{dm}:
402), B1900+01 (\gls*{dm}: 245), B2002+32 (\gls*{dm}: 234), B1933+16 (\gls*{dm}:
158), among others were detected.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

The current \gls*{sps} pipeline is undergoing a significant upgrade. The input
bandwidth is limited to 56 MHz of the full 336 MHz digital band due to IO
limitations. A new pipeline developed for \gls*{ska} \gls*{nip} will be used to
process the full \gls*{alfa} band. This will increase sensitivity, and improve
detection rate if \glspl*{frb} scintillate similar to FRB121102. An improved
version of the real-time \gls*{rfi} exciser is currently being developed and
will be deployed to reduce the false detection rate. The post-processing
classifier and prioritizer model is being updated to make use of an auto-encoder
to select deep features and auto-generate classes.

Over the time period ALFABURST has been active, the use of \gls*{alfa} has
decreased as the PALFA and AGES surveys end. The 327 MHz and L-band wide feeds
are commonly used. We are generalizing the \gls*{alfa} specific \gls*{sps}
pipeline to be used when these feeds are active, increasing our survey time and
sampling a larger portion of frequency space. Additionally, our search pipeline
will be duplicated for use on the \gls*{gbt} to be commensally run with L-band
observations.
